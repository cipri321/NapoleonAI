This makes us a family entirely devoted to the world of textiles, and we have been for generations.

My workshop is located in the district of Huaycan, a place of refuge for many immigrants who fled central Peru during the times of terrorism.

188379,188379,4659,Ravensburger Scotland Yard - Family Game,"London's famous police detectives are put to the test with this family-friendly board game. One player assumes the role of the mysterious fugitive Mister X, who is on the run in London, using the city's vast transportation network to elude the detectives in hot pursuit. The goal of the game is for Mister X to stay hidden until the very end, while the rest of the players, acting as detectives, work in concert to catch him.    Players assume the roles of Scotland Yard detectives or the elusive fugitive Mister X .  The game board features London's Transportation network - taxis, buses and underground trains - that the detectives must travel to find Mister X.   Taxis, Buses and Trains A game for would-be sleuths who love a good adventure, Scotland Yard has players assuming the role of Scotland Yard's famous detectives, who are pursuing the mysterious fugitive Mister X, on the run in London. The detectives work cooperatively to catch Mister X, utilizing London's network of taxis, buses and underground trains. The player in the role of Mister X spends the game evading capture, occasionally making appearances and leaving behind his discarded transit tickets as clues to his whereabouts.  A Cooperative Strategy Game Detective players have 22 moves in which to capture Mister X, who is invisible throughout the game except for the few times he reveals his location. This family game is big on teamwork and promotes cooperation, strategic thinking and communication skills. Scotland Yard also reinforces goal-setting and enhances turn-taking, memory skills and persistance. The setting of the game provides an educational introduction to London and its key transportation modes and familiarizes players with the famed Scotland Yard detectives.  Hunting Mister X  A family game that engages children and adults alike, Scotland Yard provides an opportunity for multiple generations to interact with one another and work together in a socially-positive environment that provides conversation starters to further engage players. This is a tactical game that connects players in a unique way and changes dramatically, depending on the role you play.  What's In The Box? 1 game board, 6 playing figures, 1 logbook, 20 cards, 125 tickets, 1 set of detailed instructions. Let's Play Scotland Yard! Which player will have the roll of the elusive Mister X? One player will function as Mister X, with the other players being Scotland Yard detectives searching for him throughout Central London. The starting station cards are shuffled and everyone draws one to determine where they will start the game. Every move is either by taxi, underground, or bus. Mister X moves first and writes his move in his travel log, indicating what method of transportation he used but not where he moved. Then, each detective makes their move, cooperating with the other detectives in an effort to close in on Mister X. Mister X only reveals where he is at certain points in the game, and the chase continues until one of the detectives moves to the place where Mister X is. In this case, the team of detectives has won the game. But, if Mister X makes 24 moves without being caught, he himself wins!",toys_and_games

Adds elegance and style to any counter top. It is a perfect complement to eShave's artistically designed razors and 100% badger hair shaving brushes. eShave T Shaving Stands - Nickel Plated With this simple belief, eShave was born. It all started in 1996 when Danielle Malka met with famous barbers in London. They picked her curiosity when talking with such enthusiasm about their clients shaving experience; nothing that compared with her husbands nor any man she knew. With them she captured the essence of wet shaving and developed the 3 steps of shaving program to bring the barbers experience home to every man and created eShave as a shaving solution to all men shaving issues. eShave is still today a unique modern brand that appeals to today men with signature scents, light textures, clean and high quality ingredients.    Shave after the shower or use a hot towel: The hot water loosens up pores and softens the hair for a closer shave. Lightly rub eShave Pre Shave Oil onto skin to provide protection and allow the razor to glide easily. Lather up a dab of Shaving Cream with a brush or your fingers to soften and raise the hair away from the skin for a closer shave. Shave with the grain using your eShave Razor. Forget pressure. Change blade often and let it glide over prepared skin in the direction of hair growth. For stubborn hair, reapply Shaving Cream and repeat shaving in a sideways motion using small strokes to prevent irritation. Around the neck area, where hair grows in different directions, run fingers along neck to feel and follow the pattern. Rinse and rub moistened eShave Alum Block against the skin to close the pores and cleanse the skin. Pat skin dry and apply eShave After Shave Soother for maximum comfort.",luxury_beauty

309768,309768,10915,Waterford Religious 5-1/2-Inch Cross,"Standing 5-1/2-inch tall, the Religious Cross is a timeless symbol of faith and tradition. Featuring starburst and fanned cuts, this beautiful crystal collectible is a radiant expression of belief and looks beautiful on any desk, vanity or shelf. Combine quarter cup ammonia with a mild lemon detergent. Rinse in clean water and air dry on a rack. Clean vases and decanters by filling them half-full with moderately hot water, a small amount of mild detergent, two tablespoons of white vinegar or ammonia and 1/2 cup uncooked rice. Swirl the rice around for a few minutes to remove residue. Waterford has been making renowned crystal pieces for more than 200 years, and they have drawn those centuries of experience to design pieces that often carry rich symbolic meaning. Waterford's 5-1/2-inch Religious cross is an inspired piece of devotional iconography, a thoughtful gift for commemorating important Christian occasions such as christenings, confirmations, or Easter. Other Waterford crystal crosses include the Medieval, Celtic, and 8-inch Standing Crosses. The Religious cross rises up from a small, two-tiered pedestal. Both the upright and the arms of the cross are gently contoured, and the three finials end in three-pointed tips; repetition of the number three is symbolic of the Trinity. Sprays of leaf cuts fan out from the center of the cross, simulating light, and an eight-rayed star sits at the central junction of the cross. The size of the cross makes it suitable for a night table or small devotional altar. To preserve the clarity of crystal and to avoid scratches, do not wash Waterford crystal in the dishwasher; harsh detergent and excessive heat could permanently etch surface of glass. Wash with a mild liquid soap in warm (not hot) water. Certain water may leave a lime or mineral deposit on the crystal; if that happens, vinegar on a soft, nonabrasive cloth will help remove the deposit. Rinse with warm water and polish with a lint-free cloth. Edges and rims are delicate; do not store upside down or place upside down on a draining board. Crystal can focus sunlight into a concentrated beam that could potentially scorch rugs or furniture, so do not store or display in direct sunlight. The Religious cross measures 5-1/2 by 3-3/4 inches. --Garland Withers",home_and_kitchen

In the late 1800s at the Battle Creek Sanatorium, a combination hospital and health spa for the elite and famous, W.K. Kellogg, business manager, and his brother, Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, chief physician, were in the process of cooking some wheat for a type of granola when they were called away. When they returned, the wheat had become stale. They decided to force the tempered grain through the rollers anyway, and surprisingly, the grain did not come out in long sheets of dough. Instead each wheat berry was flattened and came out as a thin flake. This led to the formation of the Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company in 1906, which eventually became Kellogg Company--changing the form of breakfast forever. The company that makes breakfast and snacks for millions began with only 44 employees. Today, Kellogg employs more than 25,000 people, manufactures in 17 countries, and sells its products in more than 180 countries.

In this film based on a true story, director Kirk Wong brings a gritty sense of realism to the action-filled police thriller while allowing plenty of opportunities for Jackie to show his stuff, notably in the bravura climax, a solo battle with the gang that culminates in a raging fire that devours a creaky apartment complex around them. Wong's sleek, hard-edged style meshes well with Jackie's acrobatic vigor, and Chan proves to be an adept and effective dramatic performer.

273013,273013,14175,THE STRANGER IN THE MIRROR: Dissociation: The Hidden Epidemic,"What do the Columbine killings, ""getting lost in a good book"" and your midlife crisis have in common? According to psychiatrist Steinberg, they are all events that can be placed on a broad continuum of behaviors related to dissociative identity disorder, popularly known as multiple personality. Steinberg, whose research was supported with grants from the National Institute of Mental Health, argues with conviction that mild dissociative behaviorAtemporary episodes of disconnection or memory lossAcan be a useful mechanism for coping with such mundane but stressful events as giving public presentations as well as major traumas like an operation or an assault. In more extreme forms, it is a debilitating disorderAsimilar, she argues, to attention deficit disorderAthat is in need of psychiatric recognition and intervention. Arguing that DID often results from early childhood abuse, Steinberg passionately calls for removing the stigma from its related behaviors, noting that the popular conception of the disorder is gleaned from overblown films such as Sybil and The Three Faces of Eve. Readers can gauge their own dissociative tendencies with the book's abridged version of the Steinberg clinical interview for DSM-IV dissociative disorders. Readers interested in clinical depression and ADD will gravitate to this book, although Steinberg's throwaway comments that suggest that seeing ""alternative"" lifestyles depicted on TV can cause psychic confusion and that stepparents have a greater tendency to violate the incest prohibition may cost her some otherwise sympathetic readers. While DID doesn't have as much cultural currency as ADD, Steinberg's research has much to add to the contentious debates surrounding childhood trauma, diagnostic categories and the changing relationship between incurable disease and manageable disorder. Agent, Mary Tahan. (Oct.) Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc. Multiple personality disorders (MPD) are now subsumed under the rubric dissociative identity disorders (DID), or just plain dissociation. Most DID cases are the result of physical, sexual, or emotional abuse in childhood. Psychiatrist Steinberg puts her considerable research and clinical experience to the purpose of making it clear that DID is a ""hidden epidemic,"" that many of its sufferers are misdiagnosed and fail to receive proper early treatment, and that the sensationalism of many MPD cases of yore (e.g., The Three Faces of Eve) has warped physicians' as well as public attitudes. In addition, she explodes the five most common myths about dissociation and describes its five core symptoms. She uses three long case histories to illustrate the beginning and development of DID (drunkenness and abuse played major roles in these instances), and she offers practical steps for rehabilitation. Her work in the field reached a peak when the Steinberg Clinical Interview process was given a place in the fourth edition of psychiatry's bible, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual.

381933,381933,3062,"Star Trek - The Original Series, Episode 27: Errand Of Mercy VHS","A war between the Klingons and Federation is imminent, and it's up to Captain Kirk (William Shatner) to persuade the peaceful, agrarian planet Organia to sign on with the good guys before the Klingons overwhelm the place. What's the rush? Organia is in a strategically valuable position for whichever warring side claims it first. The only problem is, the Organians don't seem to care. Kirk and First Officer Spock (Leonard Nimoy) make an awfully good pitch for Federation protection, but the planet's Council of Elders rejects the offer as a tacit invitation to violence on their world. Worse, the Council takes little heed of a Klingon invasion, insisting there is no problem and earning the enmity of both Kirk and Klingon Commander Kor (John Colicos). Essentially a Cold War satire disguised as a Federation-Klingon showdown in most unusual circumstances, ""Errand of Mercy"" is the brainchild of producer-writer Gene L. Coon, who makes a wonderfully convincing case for the absurdity of each side's claim to moral superiority. Highlights of the episode include the enigmatic, retiring performances of the Council members, and the Butch-and-Sundance banter between Kirk and Spock as they set about trying to become a two-man Resistance targeting Klingon munitions. The episode is directed by John Newland, best known as the host of the supernatural television series, One Step Beyond. --Tom Keogh Kirk and his crew come face to face with the Klingons, and both learn the meaning of war when beings from the planet Organia interfere.

This 8-volume, 24-episode series, narrated by Kenneth Branagh, is a comprehensive history that examines the key events of the arc of the Soviet Union, from its birth to its fall, and provides a thorough analysis of what was going on behind closed doors.

More Content Poser's Content Paradise now includes a host of top content providers, to bring you a diverse range of Poser 6 models, textures, poses, character packs, utilities, and free stuff. A redesigned interface makes finding Poser content faster and easier than ever before. Enhanced UI Poser's innovative UI is centered on a productive room-based environment. Individual Pose, Setup, Materials, Hair, and Cloth rooms provide easy feature access for each step in the creative process. In addition to rooms, Poser uses floating palettes and windows. You can customize your Poser workspace by hiding/displaying and relocating controls anywhere you like. You can even save up to nine different screen configurations for the entire Poser workspace. Shadow Catching Poser 6 introduces several new features to support artists in rendering more true to life shadow effects. For example the NEW Shadow Catcher feature enables you to separate shadows from their underlying surface, and put them virtually anywhere. These new features make image composition and integrating 3D figures into graphic design easier. New Toon Outlines The New Toon Outline feature uses post-processing during rendering to draw an outline around the edges of cartoon images. Poser 6 offers customizable outline styles, enabling you to further personalize your cartoon shading look. Add a distinctive style to any cartoon imagery for comics. Now you have the choice to add outlines to any cartoon imagery you create with Poser. This feature's effect is most dramatic when combined with a cartoon shader node. Configurable Cartoon Shading preview styles allow you to approximate the final render results as you work. OpenGL OpenGL delivers accelerated performance when previewing anything from cartoon to photorealistic 3D figures. Now you can display vivid textures and lighting in real-time when designing figures. You can even render high resolution images using the OpenGL Preview renderer. There are accelerated previews for your 3D scenes, so you can see vivid textures and lighting in real-time. This feature works with all Document Display Styles, including wireframe, cartoon, and more. You can render out your 3D scene display with the OpenGL Preview renderer, and easily switch between SreeD Software and OpenGL Hardware for scene previews--which means you can maximize your system's resources and spend your time creating rather than waiting. New Ambient Occlusion  Ambient Occlusion makes figures seem as though they are in the natural lighting environment of the real world. Ambient Occlusion is available on every light to create accurate soft shadow effects, thus giving scenes a new degree of realism. The new Ambient Occlusion shader node makes figures and objects appear as though they are in a natural lighting environment. Ambient Occlusion darkens surfaces within a scene whose exposure to light is blocked by other objects. This effect uses raytracing to calculate the degree to which other objects within a scene occlude the ambient light of a surface at a given point. Surfaces with more occlusion will be rendered as darker than surfaces with little or no occlusion. You can set Ambient Occlusion lighting for all objects, or select lighting effects focused on specific parts of your scene.             Meet James and Jessi                  Expand your cartoon universe with Toon Outline                 Ambient occlusion brings your figures to life More About Poser  Photorealism  Poser 6 allows you to quickly design and pose pre-rigged figures, or create original figures to suit your needs. With professional lighting effects and shading materials, a large library of content and photorealistic textures, you can create professional-quality imagery and movies. You can also integrate with other 3D applications, or composite photorealistic imagery into your favorite image editing or motion graphics programs. Just some of the features in Poser 6 include: accurate human male, female and children 3D models; large libraries of content included; quick design/pose pre-rigged figures with full morph target sets; realistic perspective in 3D space; and professional lighting effects and procedural shader material trees. Camera Controls Cameras represent your window into the Poser workspace. You can use them as a director would, to set up your ideal camera shots for each image or animation frame. Or, you can take advantage of the benefit that comes with 3D work, of being able to render a scene from multiple angles. In either case, Poser 6 offers multiple configurable cameras to facilitate your creative workflow. Poser includes a variety of independent cameras for viewing your scene, and a four-pane camera view. All are easily controlled with an innovative Trackball control for intuitive scene setup. Realistic Lighting Lighting is an essential component of any 3D image. Lights add colors, cast shadows, create specific effects, and set the tone for your scene. Poser 6's light controls allow you to add and individually configure different types of light sources in your Poser scene. When these light configuration options are combined with Poser 6's powerful rendering tools, the lighting possibilities are unlimited. Bone Rigging  Create new, fully poseable Poser figures from any 3D object in a few easy steps. Import 3D geometry, break it into body parts and generate new Poser figures. You can even create Inverse Kinematics (IK) chains. Inverse Kinematics (IK) delivers natural character motion by modeling the hierarchical interactions of bones and joints, so that when you move a hand the arm naturally follows.  OpenGL Preview New OpenGL hardware acceleration offers improved performance with figure Posing and Preview renders. Easily switch between SreeD Software and OpenGL. Hardware rendering for scene previews means you can maximize your system's resources and spend your time creating rather than waiting. Photo-based Facial Mapping Want to create a virtual you? Friend? Import facial photos to easily model new characters and create texture maps. Poser's Face Room allows you to create lifelike results by mapping any face onto a 3D head. You can also generate new faces with a button click, or create caricatures for wild characters. Ethnicity, age, and gender parameter controls round out this powerful set of facial tools.",software

194721,194721,11001,Hasbro Monopoly,"Monopoly In 1934, in the midst of the Great Depression, an unemployed heating engineer from Pennsylvania created the game of Monopoly. Realizing that his get-rich theme might appeal to other Americans, he had the game printed and distributed in a Philadelphia department store. When he couldn't keep up with the overwhelming requests for more sets, he arranged for Parker Brothers to take over the game. And the rest, as they say, is history. But Monopoly is far from a quaint historical relic. To this day, it remains a riveting game of luck, chance, and savvy wheeling and dealing--all of which can make some lucky dog rich, rich, rich! Based on the purchase of Atlantic City real estate (a city currently renowned for its get-rich gambling opportunities), Monopoly is now printed in 26 languages with more than 200 million sets sold worldwide. Players still scoot the same beloved board pieces: the old shoe, the terrier, and the hot rod. This set also includes rules for a shortened version of the game and a new token, winner of Monopoly's recent ""design a token"" contest. This is capitalism at its most fun and ruthless, a must-have edition in the family game closet. --Gail Hudson",toys_and_games
